# Contributing to LOTUSim

LOTUSim aims to foster research, experimentation, and interoperability in the field of multi-agent simulation.

This document explains how to contribute to the LOTUSim project.

Each contribution must be under EPL2.0 license.

## LOTUSim Governance Committee

The LOTUSim Governance Committee, established within Naval Group, oversees the overall coherence of the project’s developments.

The committee ensures:

- The publication of a biannual roadmap highlighting priority topics and features. The first roadmap will be available in early 2026.

- The review, acceptance and integration of community contributions,

- The publication of biannual release including the validated contributions.

In the future, the committee may include external personas such as key partners or major contributors.

## LOTUSim Roadmap

The biannual LOTUSim roadmap is based on:

- Internal needs within Naval Group,

- Partner priorities,

- Community-driven contributions.

For roadmap-related question, please contact the [Product Owner](estelle.chauveau@naval-group.com).

## How to Contribute

You can contribute in several ways:

- New features – e.g. new algorithmic modules for platform guidance.

- New models – for platforms, sensors, or environments.

- Enhancements – improving existing functions, models, documentation.

- Data contributions – use cases, simulation scenarios, or datasets.

- Bug fixes – code corrections, refactoring, or maintainability improvements.

### Contribution process

1. Create an Issue

    - If none exists, open one on GitHub.

    - Use one of the following labels: new_feature, new_model, enhancement, data, or bugfix.

    - Clearly describe your proposal, including its objectives, use cases, scientific background, and references (if relevant).

    - Specify how your contribution aligns with the LOTUSim roadmap.

2. Announce Your Work

    - In the issue comments, indicate that you plan to work on it and briefly describe your proposed solution or approach.

3. Fork and Implement

    - Fork the LOTUSim repository and implement your changes.

4. Test and Validate

    - Ensure your code passes all tests and meets projects requirements.

    - A dedicated testing guide will be available soon in the README.

5. Submit a Pull Request

    - Open a pull request referencing the related issue.

    - Clearly explain the purpose and scope of your changes.

## Pull Request Review and integration

Depending on its type, a pull request:

- may be directly accepted by the maintainers (expected feedback within 1 month), or escalated to the LOTUSim Governance Committee (feedback within 6 months).

If not directly accepted, feedback may include requests for clarification, documentation, or code improvements.

Once approved, your contribution will be merged into the main branch and included in the next release.
