@brief ROS subscriber for collecting Real-Time Factor (RTF) metrics from Gazebo.

@note
This script listens to the `/gazebo/performance_metrics` topic, extracts the
Real-Time Factor (RTF) from incoming `PerformanceMetrics` messages, stores all
received samples in memory, and optionally writes them to a CSV file.

@details
Functionality:
    - Subscribes to: /gazebo/performance_metrics (gazebo_msgs/PerformanceMetrics)
    - Extracts the `real_time_factor` field from each message.
    - Collects all RTF samples in a list.
    - Computes the mean RTF over the collected samples.
    - Exports all raw samples and the computed mean into a CSV file.

Intended Use:
    - Useful when benchmarking Gazebo simulation performance.
    - Can be used during robotic experiments to log simulation fidelity and speed.

Inputs:
    - ROS messages from `/gazebo/performance_metrics`.

Outputs:
    - A CSV file containing:
        * The full list of RTF samples
        * The computed mean RTF

Limitations:
    - Does not process CPU/GPU usage or other metrics from Gazebo.
    - Only collects and saves RTF values.
